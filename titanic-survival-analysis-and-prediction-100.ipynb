Of the estimated **2,224 passengers** and crew aboard, **more than 1,500 died**, making it the deadliest sinking of a single ship up to that time. It remains the deadliest peacetime sinking of an ocean liner or cruise ship.\n \n Titanic had advanced safety features, such as watertight compartments and remotely activated watertight doors, contributing to its reputation as \"unsinkable\". The ocean liner carried some of the wealthiest people in the world, as well as hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, and elsewhere throughout Europe, who were seeking a new life in the United States and Canada.\n \n Titanic was equipped with 16 lifeboat davits, each capable of lowering three lifeboats, for a total of 48 boats; she carried only 20 lifeboats, four of which were collapsible and proved hard to launch while she was sinking (Collapsible A nearly swamped and was filled with a foot of water until rescue, Collapsible B completely overturned while launching). Together, the **20 lifeboats could hold 1,178 peopleâ€”about half the number of passengers on board**, and one third of the number of passengers the ship could have carried at full capacity (consistent with the maritime safety regulations of the era). When the ship sank, many of the lifeboats that had been lowered were only about half full.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.014415,"end_time":"2023-01-22T07:22:55.829810","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-22T07:22:55.815395","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Importing Libraries\n# visualization\nfrom plotnine import *  # plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on ggplot2.

feature has a normal distribution with some spikes and bumps and 10 quantile based bins are used for Age. The first bin has the highest survival rate and 4th bin has the lowest survival rate. Those were the biggest spikes in the distribution. There is also an unusual group (34.0, 40.0] with high survival rate that is captured in this process.\n\n- The number of children increases with Pclass and the survival rate for passenegers below Age 10(i.e children) looks to be good irrespective of the Pclass.\n- Survival chances for Passenegers aged 20-50 from Pclass1 is high and is even better for Women.\n- For males, the survival chances decreases with an increase in age.\n\nAs we had seen earlier, the Age feature has 177 null values.

After leaving Queenstown, Titanic followed the Irish coast as far as Fastnet Rock, a distance of some 55 nautical miles (63 mi; 102 km). From there she travelled 1,620 nautical miles (1,860 mi; 3,000 km) along a Great Circle route across the North Atlantic to reach a spot in the ocean known as \"the corner\" south-east of Newfoundland, where westbound steamers carried out a change of course. Titanic sailed only a few hours past the corner on a rhumb line leg of 1,023 nautical miles (1,177 mi; 1,895 km) to Nantucket Shoals Light when she made her fatal contact with an iceberg. The final leg of the journey would have been 193 nautical miles (222 mi; 357 km) to Ambrose Light and finally to New York Harbor.\n\n\nTitanic received a series of warnings from other ships of drifting ice in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, but Captain Edward Smith ignored them. One of the ships to warn Titanic was the Atlantic Line's Mesaba. Nevertheless, the ship continued to steam at full speed, which was standard practice at the time. Although the ship was not trying to set a speed record, timekeeping was a priority, and under prevailing maritime practices, ships were often operated at close to full speed, with ice warnings seen as advisories and reliance placed upon lookouts and the watch on the bridge. It was generally believed that ice posed little danger to large vessels. Close calls with ice were not uncommon, and even head-on collisions had not been disastrous. In 1907, SS Kronprinz Wilhelm, a German liner, had rammed an iceberg but still had been able to complete her voyage, and Captain Smith himself had declared in 1907 that he \"could not imagine any condition which would cause a ship to founder. Modern shipbuilding has gone beyond that.\"\n\n# Sinking\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/9ftmF61X/Titanic-sinking-gif.gif)\n\n\nAt 11:40 pm (ship's time) on 14 April, lookout Frederick Fleet spotted an iceberg immediately ahead of Titanic and alerted the bridge. First Officer William Murdoch ordered the ship to be steered around the obstacle and the engines to be reversed, but it was too late; the starboard side of Titanic struck the iceberg, creating a series of holes below the waterline. The hull was not punctured by the iceberg, but rather dented such that the hull's seams buckled and separated, allowing water to rush in. Five of the ship's watertight compartments were breached. It soon became clear that the ship was doomed, as she could not survive more than four compartments being flooded. Titanic began sinking bow-first, with water spilling from compartment to compartment as her angle in the water became steeper.\n\n\n706 people survived the disaster and were conveyed by Carpathia to New York, Titanic's original destination, and 1,517 people died. Carpathia's captain described the place as an ice field that had included 20 large bergs measuring up to 200 feet (61 m) high and numerous smaller bergs, as well as ice floes and debris from Titanic; passengers described being in the middle of a vast white plain of ice, studded with icebergs. This area is now known as Iceberg Alley.\n\n\nFewer than a third of those aboard Titanic survived the disaster. Some survivors died shortly afterwards; injuries and the effects of exposure caused the deaths of several of those brought aboard Carpathia. The figures show stark differences in the survival rates of the different classes aboard Titanic. Although only 3% of first-class women were lost, 54% of those in third-class died. Similarly, five of six first-class and all second-class children survived, but 52 of the 79 in third-class perished. The differences by gender were even bigger: nearly all female crew members, first- and second-class passengers were saved. Men from the First Class died at a higher rate than women from the Third Class. In total, 50% of the children survived, 20% of the men and 75% of the women.\n\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/0yc49xJ0/Screenshot-3.png)\n\n\nOnly 333 bodies of Titanic victims were recovered, which amounted to one in five of the over 1,500 victims. Some bodies sank with the ship while currents quickly dispersed bodies and wreckage across hundreds of miles, making them difficult to recover. By June, one of the last search ships reported that life jackets supporting bodies were coming apart and releasing bodies to sink.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.031809,"end_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:11.653853","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:11.622044","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"f,ax=plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(18,8))\ndf_all['Survived'].value_counts().plot.pie(explode=[0,0.1],autopct='%1.1f%%',ax=ax[0],shadow=True)\nax[0].set_title('Survived')\nax[0].set_ylabel('')\nsns.countplot('Survived',data=df_all,ax=ax[1])\nax[1].set_title('Survived')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.332343,"end_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:12.016648","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:11.684305","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.416312Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.416880Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.705427Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.416811Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.704185Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.postimg.cc/KvyZDyPL/1-1300734.webp)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.032072,"end_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:12.082402","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:12.050330","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic-competition-how-top-lb-got-their-score/submission.csv')\nsubmission.to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.706776Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.707133Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.723578Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.707101Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-08-07T05:28:51.721998Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### If you liked this core, you can also check out my other works.\n\n\n\n### Thank you for your time!\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.031024,"end_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:12.145302","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-01-22T07:23:12.114278","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
